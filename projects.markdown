            <h3 class="project-title">Project 1: How does hardware work?</h3>
            <p class="project-description">
                This is my first major project. It demonstrates my understanding of AND, OR, XOR, NAND logical gates. The project showcases responsive design principles and clean, maintainable hardware.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                Through this project, I learned valuable skills in hardware development, logical design, and project organization. It serves as a foundation for my continued growth as a developer.

        <div class="project-content">
            <h3 class="project-title">Project 2: Hour of Code</h3>
            <p class="project-description">
                This project was created as part of the Hour of Code initiative. It represents my participation in the global movement to introduce people to computer science and programming.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                The Hour of Code project allowed me to create something meaningful in a short timeframe while learning new concepts and contributing to a larger educational goal.
